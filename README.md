# Renewable Bermagui website

There are a few special pages, which get direct links (eg. about, contact, homepage).

And then we can add as many posts as we like in the _posts folder.

## Writing content

All the files are markdown files.

Every page needs a special frontmatter section at the top. eg.

```
---
layout: page
background: 'img/background-image.jpg'
---
```

It tells the tool how to format each page, and where to put it, etc. and any additional information (eg. background images).

For adding new posts, just copy and modify an old one.


## pages

### index.md

index.md is the homepage.

It can be mostly empty - just add a little welcome info perhaps.

All the posts will be listed underneath the content automatically

### about.md

Overview of the project.

### contact.md

We could put our details in here maybe? Or just remove it?
