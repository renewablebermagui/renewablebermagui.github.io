## About Renewable Bermagui

We are a community-led volunteer organisation based in Bermagui on the Far South Coast of New South Wales, formed in early 2024. We are working to bring events, education, and support our community in transitioning to renewable and sustainable technologies.

We are a local chapter of the [Cobargo and District Energy Transition group (CaDET)](https://renewablecobargo.com){:target="_blank"}.
