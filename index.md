## Know Your Energy Bill Workshop - recap & resources

Thanks to everyone for coming to our Know Your Energy Bill workshop on August 24th, with David Neyle. We loved everyone's engagement in the presentation and hands on session, and hope you got a lot out of it. We've made the resources from the workshop available for download from our [Resources](renewablebermagui.org/resources){:target="_blank"} page.
